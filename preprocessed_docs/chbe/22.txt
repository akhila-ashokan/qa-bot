aleczandria tiffany aleczandria tiffany quest knowledge know bound story academic journey angeles urbana champaign abroad sydney australia may foreseen career trajectory term discipline location destination brought new opportunity pursue intellectual curiosity like many scientist innate inquisitiveness foundation upon built career young girl tiffany would ask parent load question world around answer equipped book find answer tiffany seeking answer ever since would read book animal ocean animal amazon said became obsessed learning new thing new topic came potential career marine biologist botanist forensic scientist geologist made list point every time thought subject cool wanted type scientist said high school science teacher encouraged become engineer chose chemical engineering based aptitude chemistry time question tool employ grown complexity university southern california completed bachelor degree tiffany decided participate work study program would look great resume help afford live lab professor richard robers worked postdoctoral scholar use mrna display technique used vitro protein evolution design new peptide selectively bound agr protein overexpressed cancer opportunity rediscovered love explore unknown passion biology found really like lab fun exciting discovering something new said asked time graduate student undergraduate lab encouraged attend graduate school applied several top chemical biomolecular engineering program across country goal attend best school possible several happened midwest visiting school felt illinois realest people said felt like honest willing answer question felt like student comfortable around professor found still mostly true illinois broad expertise chemical biomolecular engineering tiffany able pivot industrial focus undergraduate program blossoming interest biomedicine began phd program tiffany took part summer predoctoral institute spi provides opportunity incoming graduate student underrepresented population start graduate work illinois creating cohort colleague grow academia spi found research project graduate advisor robert w schaefer professor brendan harley got jumpstart group getting acclimated trained summer really nice said tiffany work improving biomaterials bone repair specifically interested large scale injury caused trauma explosion experienced soldier said changing composition material order improve specific cellular output including cell migration vessel infiltration mineral deposition increasing speed large scale injury normally heal able heal goal far say already testing material animal model refine material pursuing human trial surprisingly intellectual curiosity encouraged branch project want explore repurpose material application thinking use material study disease depth said repurpose existing material study bone cancer osteoporosis vitro line thinking admittedly distaste illinois winter led tiffany sydney australia work scientia associate professor kris kilian university new south wale kilian lab interested chemistry material influence behavior mammalian cell study cell variety different architecture see behave better study biology tiffany said worked developing hydrogel model mimic bone lung type bone cancer called osteosarcoma metastasizes lung survivability decrease work kilian tiffany learned new material different cell type printing evaluation technique like confocal microscopy mastered process culture endothelial cell fibroblast bone cancer cell working lab exploring land husband kaelin visited brisbane melbourne hopped new zealand however year long adventure cut short pandemic returned illinois three month early august despite unforeseen circumstance tiffany regret opportunity made possible gumption love travel grant national science foundation called graduate research opportunity worldwide grow favorite thing science math global enterprise said really anywhere grant awarded based tiffany research proposal said honestly quite fun put together contrary popular belief even graduate student little said read paper bone cancer paper breast cancer like oh still interested different topic exactly wanted back undergraduate working lab learning something new time currently applying postdoctoral research position cell biology disease modeling phd expertise material development characterization like learn complex cell biology technique said feel lost reading complex biology paper know information would beneficial work biomaterials development next step academia otherwise remains seen thing certain settling anything le best opportunity tackle big question alongside like minded scientist collaboration key career success satisfaction like thing love collaborating people lab said collaboration critical science advance diverse team ask question push boundary science someday create cohesive research program combine material development cell biology create really
