I'm coming from a community college where I focused on gen-ed and environmental biology. But before that, I had taken some theatre courses at two institutions (Columbia College Chicago and NEIU ). Besides a few theater credits from there, I also have a number of years of experience in acting, on big and small stages in Chicago, including Goodman Theatre, 16th Street Theatre, Urban Theater Company, Chicago Dramatists, and Stage Center Theatre. I also have experience acting in short films and student films. \n\nI seriously love performing and whether I even touch it at all in school, I'm always going to do it, but I also really want to learn the craft as much as I can. I don't feel pressured by time and money (even if I should), so if I need to add an extra year I may as well.\n\nI've researched the Theater Minor here at UIUC and am unsure if that is enough to satisfy my yearning to learn. So, my question becomes, how feasible is it to a dual degree in theatre and crop sciences, two completely unrelated fields, ^(unless I decided to put on Shakespeare on the Farm.)  I realize the acceptance rate in the Theater Acting BFA is seriously rigorous with only 40 students admitted each year, but I'm willing to try and beat the odds and audition for the next available semester.\n\nI suppose it is completely possible as long as I have the willpower and patience to do both majors, but please do let me know your opinions and perspectives.!\n\nTLDR, I'm a Fall 2022 junior transfer into ACES Crop Sciences, but I am also an experienced actor with years of non-college practice.

Will she be more successful because UIUC offers better support to the students?   \n Purdue engineering has always been known as a meat grinder.  Is UIUC too?  Can she make more as a co-op to help offset the price difference?  Will she make more when she graduates to justify the cost difference?  Looked at both schools' metrics and there's little difference in co-op and post-grad salaries.  Being totally respectful here as we've toured both schools, both are fantastic but really struggling with what amounts to $60k over 4 yrs.

I read about UIUC applying for the UEC (University earned credit) program from the SOA. It seems that this is a pretty contentious issue among the actuarial community at least from looking at r/actuary. What's the general consensus of students and professors regarding the program then?\n2. Scrolling through the subreddit, it seems that act sci was starting to recover after losing an important faculty member a few years ago. What is the state of the program now?\n3. How does UIUC lean on SOA/CAS. Which route is more popular amongst students and which does the university better prepare you for?\n4. Finally, I'm an international student and was wondering about the difficulty of landing an actuarial job/internship. Can anyone from UIUC comment on that since act sci seems to be a major with many international students.")

I was speaking to a *rejected* guy the other day, who was talking about his ML internship at NUS..... I had to google what ML meant. I mean I knew what Machine Learning was, but I'm just so inexperienced that I didn't know it was just commonly called ML. Some of my fellow admits have international CS olympiad medals, research at t10 universities, FIRST robotics, the list goes on and on. I had ONE CS extracurricular, I taught kids basic programming through scratch and thunkable. I also completed Stanford online's CS50 course on edX, which if you've gone through, you'll realize how ridiculously easy it is. I genuinely am stumped as to what got me in. I wrote my activity essay about failing to jailbreak my iPhone in the sixth grade. And I wrote this another essay about human centered AI to safe refineries such as the one my dads works in. I genuinely have no clue what got me in, I'm not low income and have didn't apply for aid.  I fear I'll noticeably be the worst, and if ranks are published, I'll probably be at the bottom of the class. This is not imposter syndrome, this is the truth. \n\nCurrent computer related majors at UIUC, I need your help. How the f\\*ck do I catch up with these absolute Gods? I'm looking for this basic checklist type thing which I should accomplish before starting this fall. Here's my current skillset/experience:\n\n4 years of Python, 2 years of JS, and SQL since the sixth or seventh grade. I did actively take part in an ML project for traffic safety, but I was only selected to be a part of that team as I was the only one who had written a research paper before (particle physics, even in that project I handled none of the programming parts). Was it technically a CS extracurricular? Yes, but I didn't program shit, all I did was come up with the idea but none of the programming. I'm currently learning kotlin and swift, and also trying to build my second ML project, a sudoku solver. I think my experience displays an understanding of the logic part of programming but idk syntax for shit. \n\nHelp me out guys please this post is not a joke")

Looking at my course equivalency eval, it seems as if I got credit for cs 225, which is data structures and algorithms at UIUC. I have never taken this class before and am not familiar at all with the material here. \n\nI think I know why UIUC made the mistake. It\'s probably because I took a class titled "Programming and Intro Data Structures", which kinda sounds similar to ds&amp;a, but the course I took is actually a pre-req to my school\'s equivalent to ds&amp;a. \n\nSo my question is about what I should do in this situation. I know that UIUC considers major preparation quite heavily for transfer admission, so do you think telling them that I actually haven\'t taken a cs225 equivalent will cause me to be rescinded? I\'m considering just taking the class at my uni the summer before my hypothetical enrollment at UIUC.')

As I come from a middle class family, getting a job after college is really important for me. My interest is in Finance. If i pursue the BS in Finance.

And, i only have 1 year to appear for the H-1B visa process. \n\nAs an international student at UIUC, what are your plans after college and if you're staying in the USA how do you plan to do it?
