Curriculum Map
Curriculum Information
Our curriculum provides two areas of concentration: chemical engineering and biomolecular engineering. Each area is based on a strong fundamental understanding of chemical engineering; the biomolecular concentration’s technical electives focus more on bio-applied processing and technology.

Academic Advisors
Academic Advisers in the School of Chemical Sciences assist students on course selection and guide them through their field of studies. They also ensure that our students meet all degree requirements and help with registration issues, declaring a minor, etc. We encourage students to first meet with their academic advisors; however, your faculty advisor can provide guidance on career planning or graduate school; your academic advisor can help you identify your faculty advisor to schedule a consultation.
