AIChE Reception

It was our pleasure to host so many friends, alumni, and colleagues at our reception on November 8, 2021, at the 2021 Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers­ where we recognized two years of awards and recognition that have been bestowed upon our distinguished faculty members.
In addition to the accolades listed below, we celebrated the addition of assistant professors Xiao Su and Alex Mironenko and specialized teaching faculty Uzoma Monye and Joachim Floess to our department. 
I hope very much to see you at our reception next year held during the 2022 annual meeting (November 13-18, 2022) at the Phoenix Convention Center + Hyatt Regency in Phoenix, AZ. 
Thank you for your ongoing engagement.
