Spring 2022 Guidelines & Returning to Campus â€“ COVID-19
Travel increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission. In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, after Spring Break the university will require return testing for undergraduate students.
If you receive a positive off-campus COVID-19 test result while you are away from campus, you should not return until you have finished your isolation. You should follow public health directives from your county.
Please consider supporting COVID relief efforts, including the SHIELD initiative or direct student funding, by making a gift  today!
