Working in university facilities – COVID-19
The university is committed to doing all we can to maximize the safety of all members of our community. As we return to limited onsite work, operations will be adjusted and it will be critical that we make personal choices to protect each other against the spread of COVID-19. This page has guidance and information for employees who are working on-campus.
Every member of the community should monitor their own health and conduct a daily health check, following CDC guidelines.
If you do not feel well, contact your supervisor, do not report for in-person work and seek medical advice.
Employees who might have childcare obligations, live with a family member who is in an increased risk population, self-identify as being at increased risk or have other concerns should contact their supervisor or unit HR contact as soon as possible if there is a need to continue remote-work arrangements. Some situations may require the use of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) interactive accommodations process.
More information is available on the Remote Work page.
The university asked colleges, institutes and major units to create localized unit plans for returning to in-person operations. Additionally, each unit has been asked to identify at least one COVID Coordinator to be the point person for COVID-related efforts for their unit.
Employees who will be working in-person in a university facility should closely review their unit’s plans for specific guidance for working in the unit’s facilities.
The College and Unit Information page has the unit plans and contact info for COVID Coordinators.
