How to test and receive results – COVID-19
The test is available to current students, faculty, staff and retirees at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who have active NetIDs. 
Community members, family members and visitors can test through SHIELD CU. Please visit the SHIELD CU website for more information, including testing locations and hours.
The test is free.
You should refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing, and tobacco use for at least one hour before submitting your saliva sample at the test location.
Make sure you bring your current iCard or have the Illinois app downloaded.
You will be asked to provide a saliva sample. The sample collection only takes a few minutes.
When you arrive at an on-campus testing location, you will be asked the following questions:
You can choose to not answer the next two questions, in which case “unknown” will be selected. The Illinois Department of Public Health has requested we ask each person’s race who is tested on-campus. Providing this information is optional for each person who is tested.
Individuals will verify that their name is correct on the test tube label. Next, you will move to a saliva station where you will take the lid off the test tube and dribble saliva into the tube. Once complete, replace the lid and take the tube to the collection station.
At collection, you will hold up your test tube so staff can confirm that there is enough saliva in the tube. Staff will ask that you return to a test station if enough saliva is not in the tube.
You will be offered a copy of a COVID-19 Test Fact Sheet for Patients. If you do not want to take a physical copy, an online copy is available in PDF format.
Typical test results are expected within 12 hours, but results could take up to 48 hours.
The University of Illinois COVID Wellness Answer Center is available to answer questions about on-campus testing and results. 
Please contact the COVID Wellness Answer Center by email at covidwellness@illinois.edu or call 217-333-1900. Please email for faster response times.
Invalid results typically occur when non-optimal saliva samples are submitted. Before your next test, please be sure to refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, or tobacco use for at least 1 hour prior to submitting your saliva sample. For best results, it is recommended to hydrate during the morning and get tested in the afternoon.
Go to your MyMcKinley portal. Click the “Labs” tab in the menu and select your test result to print an official copy.
