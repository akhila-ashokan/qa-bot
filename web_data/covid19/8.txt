Face Coverings – COVID-19
N95 and KN95 masks provide medical-grade protection. 
Level 3 surgical masks provide additional protection compared to other disposable face masks. Disposable face masks provide coverage against droplet spread, but they may not hold up to repeated wear or washing.
Cloth masks provide protection against droplet spread. 
A face shield, often made of plastic, usually fits over the individual’s head, although some are neck-mounted.
A face shield is not an adequate substitute for a face covering. Face shields should only be used as an additional layer of protection or used temporarily as detailed below.
A face shield does not fit tight against your face, and therefore it does not provide the same level of protection against droplet spread as a properly worn face covering. As an alternative, units can purchase clear face masks through Central Stores by searching for “smile mask.”
A face shield is different than a face covering. If using a forehead-mounted clear shield, the shield should extend from ear-to-ear and to the bottom of the speaker’s chin when their mouth is open. For a neck-mounted shield, it should be angled so that no droplets can escape around the sides or top of the shield. 
It is only acceptable to temporarily use a face shield instead of a face covering, and only in these circumstances:
A clear face covering is different than a face shield. Clear face coverings fit snugly and have a clear window so the speaker’s lips are visible. 
If you are a student and have an ADA accommodation, you can request a clear face covering through DRES. For more information, please contact Tina Cowsert (tcowsert@illinois.edu).
If you are a faculty or staff member and have an ADA accommodation, you can request a clear face covering from the ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity by contacting adadivision@illinois.edu. 
If you do not have an accommodation, but you would like a clear face covering, units can purchase them through Central Stores by searching for “smile mask.”
Individuals with a medical condition or disability that prevents them from safely wearing a face covering may seek a reasonable accommodation. Students needing an accommodation should contact the division of Disability Resources & Educational Services (DRES), and employees (including student employees) needing workplace accommodations should contact the ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity.
Individuals who are not comfortable meeting one-on-one in their offices without face coverings may do the following:
