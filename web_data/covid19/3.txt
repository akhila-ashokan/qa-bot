Illinois App – COVID-19
The Illinois App is the primary way for faculty, staff and students to display their COVID-19 Building Access Status. 
The COVID-19 Boarding Pass will continue to be an alternate way faculty, staff and students can display their Building Access Status. 
Please note that on-campus test results will still be available in the MyMcKinley Portal, and you will receive an email when there is a new result. Test results will not be available in the Illinois app.
