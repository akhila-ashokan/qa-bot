Visitors – COVID-19
In accordance with Phase 5 of the Restore Illinois plan, invited guests and visitors are welcome on campus. Anyone visiting campus should be aware of the following practices.
There are no COVID-19 vaccination/testing requirements for visitors. However, visitors from outside the campus community are encouraged to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 if they are able to do so. If visitors are unvaccinated, they are welcome to utilize the SHIELD CU testing program.
Academic buildings will be monitored through spot checking by Wellness Support Associates (WSAs) during hours when classes are being held. University hosts or venue organizers are expected to escort invited guests and visitors into these buildings. Visitors should consult with the unit, host or venue organizer for gaining entry into these facilities.
Guest speakers from within the campus community should be treated like any other instructor. Guest speakers from outside the campus community should be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 if they are able to do so. If guest speakers are unvaccinated, the expectation is that they have received a recent negative COVID-19 test. They are welcome to utilize the SHIELD CU testing program.
Instructors who invite guest speakers are responsible for communicating these expectations to them. However, instructors should not be collecting any vaccination information or documentation.
