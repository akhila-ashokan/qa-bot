On-Campus Students – COVID-19
Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a mandate that all state employees and university students must be vaccinated against COVID-19. All students, faculty and staff are required to be fully vaccinated with a university-accepted COVID-19 vaccine.
Learn more about the vaccine requirement.
You should insert and/or update your “Student Location” in Student Self-Service every time your living location changes. Typically, this is at the beginning of each academic year but could change throughout the year. 
Maintaining updated location information enables campus health and wellness units to communicate proper protocols to students that will help us all maximize safety during the pandemic.
Students need to take responsibility for checking their symptoms every day. Students who feel ill must not come to class. 
In addition, students who test positive for COVID-19 or have had an exposure that requires testing and/or quarantine must not attend class. The University will provide information to the instructor, in a manner that complies with privacy laws, about students in these latter categories. These students are judged to have excused absences for the class period and should contact the instructor via email about making up the work.    
Each instructor has a class-specific attendance policy. Students should review each course section’s attendance policies, which should be in the course syllabus, and establish open communication with instructors by asking for clarification on any aspect of these policies. If an instructor asks for a verified absence letter from the Office of the Dean of Students, students can submit requests via this website after they have returned to class following their absence.
Undergraduates with questions or concerns should consult with their academic advisors or college office, and graduate students should consult with their advisors or the Graduate College.
