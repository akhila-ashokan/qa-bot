Vaccination and booster appointments
CUPHD is leading vaccine distribution for our county. The university does not control the vaccine appointments, timelines or community clinic locations. Champaign County residents with questions about vaccines should contact CUPHD by phone (217-239-7877) or email (coronavirus@c-uphd.org).
For boosters, mix and match of the approved vaccines is permissible. When you go to get your booster, bring your original vaccination card if possible.
Students can get vaccinated on-campus by making an appointment in their MyMcKinley Portal.
You can use vaccines.gov to look for available appointments nearby.
Please continue to check the websites of local pharmacies for available vaccine appointments. Area pharmacies may add new appointment slots throughout the week, so continue to check their websites frequently.
The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District is providing vaccination opportunities through community clinics located throughout the county. Please continue to check the CUPHD website to see if there are any appointments available.
Please consider supporting COVID relief efforts, including the SHIELD initiative or direct student funding, by making a gift  today!
