Outreach
Illinois was established as a land-grant institution to be a beacon of knowledge and service for our state and nation.
This fuels a mission to educate broadly, whether through local summer camps, free online classes available worldwide, or Illinois Extension, which has been offering educational programs throughout the state and beyond for more than 100 years. This combined impact helps to power the world.
