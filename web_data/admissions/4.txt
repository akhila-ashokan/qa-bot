You can apply for financial aid by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is available regardless of financial need. Using the FAFSA results, our Office of Student Financial Aid will prepare a Financial Aid Notification for you detailing the total amount of financial aid you’ll receive.
Complete FAFSA
If you're an Illinois resident who isn't otherwise eligible for federal financial aid, you can submit the Alternative Application for Illinois Financial Aid.

UIUC strives to keep costs affordable. Not only have merit and need-based aid increased in recent years, but our students also take out fewer loans and graduate with less debt than the national average.
National Graduates$28,950 average loan debt(per borrower)
State of Illinois Graduates$29,666 average loan debt(per borrower)
UIUC Graduates$22,830 average loan debt(per borrower)
No need-based financial aid is available to international undergraduates, and F-1 visas allow very limited opportunities for students to work at the university. For this reason, you must have sufficient funds for your entire period of study. However, limited scholarships and loans exist through International Student and Scholar Services.
