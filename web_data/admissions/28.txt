Scholarships, Undergraduate Admissions, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
When you apply to UIUC, you’re automatically considered for our merit-based scholarships. Many of these are for first-year and transfer students in any college based on academic excellence, though awards are also given out based on major. All scholarships are for fall and spring semesters unless otherwise noted.
View List
To be considered for need-based scholarships, you need to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). If you're an Illinois resident who isn't otherwise eligible for federal financial aid, you can submit the Alternative Application for Illinois Financial Aid. You can also submit a supplemental form for scholarships awarded by the Office of Student Financial Aid.
You can find national and independently administered awards, along with several free online search services, through our Office of Student Financial Aid.
