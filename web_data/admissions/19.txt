Financial Aid Notification
In order to be eligible to receive financial aid, you must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). If you haven’t yet submitted the FAFSA, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible. You must be admitted to the university before financial aid processing begins. We’ll begin sending financial aid notifications in mid-March.
Viewing the Financial Aid Notification
To view your financial aid notification, log in to myIllini and click on your application for admission to visit your admitted checklist. If your financial aid notification is available, you’ll see a prompt within the financial aid section of the checklist urging you to view it. Follow the instructions provided to do so.
