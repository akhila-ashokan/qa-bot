Along with the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Testing System (IELTS) can also be used to show English proficiency. The typical scores for admission are a total of 7.5 to 8, with a score of at least 6 on all 4 modules.
Middle 50% means half of the students we admitted scored within the listed range.  It also means 25% of the students we admitted had scores below the range and 25% had scores above.
If the middle 50% range is X-Y, 50% of the students we admitted scored in that range, 25% scored below X and 25% scored above Y.
Having numbers below or above the range doesn't guarantee you will be admitted or denied as many factors contribute to a student's decision.
