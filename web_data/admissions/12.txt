Before applying as a transfer student, you'll want to learn our course and GPA requirements, which of your classes will transfer, whether your intended major is considering applicants, and more. You can find links to all of these resources on our transfer application preparation page.
We’ve created a guide to help you navigate our transfer application process. We hope it helps as you begin your planning!

You'll choose a major, write an essay, and list your extracurriculars, work experience, honors, and awards. Note that we'll also use your application to determine admission into campus honors programs and award merit-based scholarships.
When you submit your application, you'll pay a nonrefundable fee by credit card. If you’re a domestic student at the University of Illinois at Chicago or Springfield, you don’t need to submit a fee.
We need official transcripts from all colleges or universities you've attended. We also need a final, official transcript from your high school or your high school equivalency exam results to confirm you’ve graduated. When you apply, ask that these institutions send your official transcripts directly to our office.
If you have fewer than 30 graded transferable semester hours of college coursework when you apply, you can choose to submit official ACT or SAT scores if you feel they will add value to your application. Scores must be sent directly from the testing agency and dated within five years of your enrollment at UIUC.
You must meet one of our listed conditions to satisfy our minimum English proficiency requirement. In many cases, the standards needed to gain admission will be much higher, so it’s worth submitting all test scores showing a high level of English competency. Test scores must be dated within two years of your enrollment at UIUC.
Depending on your background or the major you're applying to, you may have just a few more things to do.
You'll need to follow these additional steps during the application process.
You also need to submit a portfolio. More information is available through the School of Art and Design or by calling 217-333-6632.
You also need to complete an audition. More information is available through the Department of Dance or by calling 217-333-1010.
You also need to complete a music application and audition or interview. More information is available through the School of Music or by calling 217-244-7899.
You also need to interview and complete an audition or portfolio review. More information is available through the Department of Theatre or by calling 217-333-2371.
