We're giving you everything you need to plan your trip to UIUC. We can't wait to see you on campus soon!
Prior to attending an admissions-related event, please be aware of the following guidelines. Note that these guidelines currently apply to events held on campus and at the Illini Center in Chicago, home to our Chicago Satellite Office:
For additional information related to campus guidelines, visit our COVID-19 website.
If you plan to drive, I-72, I-74, and I-57 all lead directly to Champaign-Urbana. You can also arrive by train or bus at the Illinois Terminal , which is two miles away from campus, or you can fly to Champaign's Willard Airport , which is five miles away from campus. Visitor parking for Admissions programs is available at meters on campus. We recommend downloading the MobileMeter app before your visit. Please note that no free parking is available on weekdays.

After signing up for a visit, you'll receive confirmation of your events via email.
Check-in will begin 30 minutes before the start of our program. We'll kick things off with a 45-minute presentation, including time for questions. Next, you'll have a chance to ask current students your questions during a 15-minute student panel. A student will then lead you on an hour-and-a-half walking tour through the heart of campus, so be sure to wear good walking shoes and come prepared for all weather conditions!
Academic program details vary by academic community. You can view a description of each program on our sign-up page. If you have questions regarding an academic program you've signed up for, don't hesitate to reach out directly to that academic community prior to your visit.
The Admissions campus tour includes a housing tour of our Illinois Street Residence (ISR) Halls. Additional housing tours are offered from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. every weekday. Walk-in tours offered through University Housing include Nugent Hall or a more in-depth look at Illinois Street Residence (ISR) Halls. You can also pre-arrange a Private Certified Housing tour directly with the facility of your choice.
