International Applicants, Undergraduate Admissions, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
In addition to following the standard admission steps as a first-year or transfer applicant, you should be aware of the following requirements.
To be considered for admission, you must complete a program of study that qualifies you for admission to selective universities in your own country. First-year applicants must report their academic credentials when they apply. Following are first-year application tips:
We require certain documents depending on where you're from. Transfer applicants need to send these to us when they apply. First-year students should wait until after they're admitted.
Find your country
If you’re from a country that requires military service upon completion of secondary education, you shouldn't apply until this obligation has been met. We won't delay admission in this case.
As an admitted international student, you'll also have to take additional steps in order to enroll. While you don't need to do any of these things right now, we thought you might want to take note!
