The experiences you have when you study abroad are going to change the way you look at the world and your life in relation to it.
Where you study abroad is up to you. Through our programs, you have the freedom to choose the place you want to experience, how long you want to be there, and even the language in which you want to be taught.

Below is a small sampling of the places you can explore and the things you can do when you study abroad.

Boost your professional experience by participating in an internship with local organizations.
Become fluent in classes taught only in Italian while exploring what Europe’s oldest university has to offer.
Help to restore the country’s tropical rainforests while studying current ecological issues and performing hands-on research.
