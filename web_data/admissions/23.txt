If you want to transfer to UIUC, follow the required and recommended course sequences listed in our handbook. Information is subject to change and doesn’t constitute a contract between you and UIUC.
You must select a major on your application for admission. In addition, you may also list a second-choice major. It's important to consult the Transfer Handbook when considering your transfer options to ensure you meet specific course and GPA requirements. Select the college you want to transfer into, then find the program you’re interested in. For most majors, our handbook will provide a recommended course sequence, with transfer prerequisite requirements listed in red italics. Compare the recommended courses against your potential transfer credits.
