James Scholar Honors Program
Scholar Showcase
EDUC 102 Poster Presentations
Instructor Adam Poetzel and his EDUC 102 James Scholar students host a poster session each year at the College of Education. Faculty, staff, and peers interact with the James Scholar Education students as they share their research.
These first-year students are enrolled in the Freshman Honors Seminar course and are studying in the Collegeâ€™s early childhood, elementary, special education, learning & education studies, and middle grades programs. The budding researchers cover a variety of topics, such as the benefits and drawbacks of year-round schooling for elementary schools; low-income students and literacy rates in the U.S.; the benefits of implementing social and emotional learning education in elementary classrooms; and how student teaching abroad impacts pre-service teachers.
