  Pre-Engineering

If you are not in PREP but interested in the program, please consult the ICT to PREP website.
Pre-Engineering Advisor: A designated Pre-Engineering academic advisor in the Division of General Studies will help students navigate their academic journey. To schedule an appointment with a PREP advisor, click here.  Advising is required each semester before being able to register for classes. Please note: PREP advisors are only able to meet with current PREP students.
The Grainger College of Engineering Campus Resources: Many of the programs within the College of Engineering are also available for students in PREP, such as CARE, IPENG, and WIE.
Engineering Coursework: In addition to exploratory courses, students will also gain better access to some introductory major courses within the Grainger College of Engineering curriculum.

Core Technical Coursework: PREP students should progress as much as possible in the core technical courses in order to show their aptitude and readiness to transfer. While individual Engineering majors have specific requirements, students in PREP will also need to show progress in the following coursework:
Course Sequencing: Students will work closely with PREP advisors to both determine the most appropriate schedule based on placement test information and potential AP/IB/Dual Enrollment credit and also ensure specific course requirements are being met for majors of interest. Those who are ahead in the suggested sequence for the major (e.g., through AP or proficiency credit) are still expected to continue taking an appropriate engineering course load. 
Good Standing:  Standing in PREP is reviewed each semester.  To maintain Good Standing in PREP students must:
Consequences of not maintaining Good Standing in PREP may be placement on PREP Warning Status or removal from PREP and reassignment to Undeclared in DGS. 
PREP students will have a hold placed on their account on the 11th day of the semester. In order to add or drop a course after the 11th day, a PREP student should meet with an advisor, who will complete the PREP Late Course Change Form.
When meeting with an advisor to drop a course, students will discuss which course they want to drop, why, and the potential implications of dropping that course (i.e. staying on track in the PREP curriculum, maintaining full-time academic status, satisfying financial aid requirements). Additionally, students cannot drop a course if it will place them below 12 credit hours unless they have been approved for an underload that semester.
Students considering dropping the following courses should know that doing so could jeopardize their ability to make satisfactory progress and remain in Pre-Engineering:
When meeting with an advisor to add or change sections of a course, students will receive a copy of the PREP Late Course Change Form to have signed by the course instructor and department (unless it is a 2nd 8 week course). They must return the form to the DGS office in order for the change to be processed and finalized. Students should be aware that even if a course is open when they complete the form, it does not guarantee that seats will be available when the form is processed.
If students are interested in adding a 2nd 8 week course, they should consider the following before submitting the PREP Late Course Change Form:
      
The following is historical data. In no way does this represent any individual student’s probability of being admitted into a specific program within the Grainger College of Engineering.
The data below represents students who have successfully applied to the Grainger College of Engineering and were accepted into their first-choice majors since the first transfer period in Spring 2018. These students remained in PREP Good Standing according to the criteria listed above and were eligible to apply to the Grainger College of Engineering at the end of their time in PREP.
   
Students preparing to transfer to the Grainger College of Engineering can read about the ICT application process here.
In order to apply to the Grainger College of Engineering, students in PREP will complete and submit their Engineering Portfolio.  Criteria for submitting the Engineering Portfolio are:
To be eligible for guaranteed admission to an OPEN CAPACITY major in the Grainger College of Engineering, students in PREP must meet the following minimum requirements:
The specialized GPA is calculated based on all foundational technical courses required of the Engineering core curriculum as well as any Engineering courses taken. The full list can be found on the Engineering Undergraduate Advising WIKI.
PREP Students must complete an online ICT application called the Engineering Portfolio in order to apply for Intercollegiate Transfer to the Grainger College of Engineering by the listed deadline each semester.  Students will usually apply during or just after their second or third semester at the University of Illinois.  The fourth semester at Illinois is the last opportunity PREP students have to submit the Engineering Portfolio.  Review by the Grainger College of Engineering will occur after grades are posted at the end of the semester.
PREP students are required to meet with a PREP advisor at least once a semester to discuss their academic progress and to maintain an Engineering Portfolio.
