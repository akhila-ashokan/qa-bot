Important Dates & Announcements

Covid-19 and Impact on VA Benefits
Reminder: COVID-19 legislation that permits you to receive Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) at the resident rate, while taking approved converted (online) courses, will end on December 21, 2021. When enrolling for courses in 2022 or any subsequent term, you will need to enroll in approved resident classes to continue receiving your MHA at the resident rate. Additionally, if you are enrolled in converted courses that continue past December 21, 2021 AND have been receiving your MHA at the resident rate due to COVID-19, your MHA will be reduced to the online rate on December 22, 2021.
Enrollment Certification Processing Timeline by Term
**Please note that once the online VECR application closes for a given term, your enrollment may still be certified for that term, however you must request a paper VECR request form by emailing osfaveterans@illinois.edu.**
Other Important Dates



*VA’s 30 day drop period: The brief period at the beginning of a term officially designated for dropping courses without academic penalty. The school’s last day to drop a course will be the end of the drop period, providing it does not exceed 30 days from the first day of the term. The drop period determines if we must report the drop as punitive or non-punitive grades assigned. The action VA takes differs for non-punitive and punitive grades.*
