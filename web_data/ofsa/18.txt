Office of Student Financial Aid
How to Apply
To be considered for most forms of financial aid awarded by our office, you need to complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The University of Illinois Federal School Code is 001775.
Students interested in being considered for state aid as part of the RISE Act can learn more about the Alternative Application here.
If you’re applying for financial aid for Fall 2022, Spring 2023, or Summer 2023, complete the 2022-2023 FAFSA.
The FAFSA may be completed beginning October 1, 2021, and must be submitted prior to your last date of attendance or June 15, 2023, whichever is earlier. You will use 2020 income and tax information to complete your 2022-2023 FAFSA. Our preferential filing date is March 15, 2022; however, you are encouraged to submit your FAFSA no later than January 5, 2022 to be considered for all federal, state and institutional financial aid programs.
Students who are planning to attend Summer 2023 must also complete an OSFA summer financial aid application. The application will be available on our OSFA homepage.
If you’re applying for financial aid for Fall 2021, Spring 2022, or Summer 2022, complete the 2021-2022 FAFSA.
The FAFSA may be completed beginning October 1, 2020, and must be submitted prior to your last date of attendance or June 15, 2022, whichever is earlier. You will use 2019 income and tax information to complete your 2021-2022 FAFSA. Our preferential filing date is March 15, 2021; however, you are encouraged to submit your FAFSA no later than January 5, 2021 to be considered for all federal, state and institutional financial aid programs.
Students who are planning to attend Summer 2022 must also complete an OSFA summer financial aid application. The application will be available on our OSFA homepage.
Other FAFSA Application Information
Students and parents also need to create a Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID to electronically sign federal student aid documents, including the FAFSA. To create your FSA ID, please visit Federal Student Aid’s website.
Additional information on how to complete the FAFSA is available through the 7 Easy Steps to the FAFSA: A Student’s Guide to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid tutorial.
Scholarship Application Information
Academic awards and scholarships are primarily awarded by the college or department in which the student is enrolled. Search for a scholarship will help you identify scholarships. Students are also encouraged to complete the Undergraduate Scholarship Supplement Form. This form collects supplemental information that’s used in the selection of recipients for restricted scholarship funds.
Making a Change
If there was a significant change in your family situation from the information on either the 2022-2023 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), OSFA can re-evaluate financial aid eligibility to reflect catastrophic changes in the family financial situation. This process is called a Special Circumstance.
If there was a significant change from the information on the 2022-2023 FAFSA, please review https://secure.osfa.illinois.edu/specialcirc/ to determine if you might qualify for a re-evaluation.
For adjustments to be made, the total household income must be at least 20% less with a minimum of a $2,000 decrease. If you are seeking a review of the 2022-2023 FAFSA, there must be a significant loss in either 2021 or projected 2022 income.
Please note that OSFA will only re-evaluate your financial aid eligibility under serious circumstances.
Requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and your submission of the form does not guarantee we will be able to award additional funding. The University of Illinois does not negotiate financial aid or try to match offers from other colleges.
COVID-19 Loss of Income in 2022
If your family finances have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) can re-evaluate your eligibility for need-based aid or unexpected educational expenses. The 2022-2023 FAFSA is based on 2020 income, but in very limited circumstances, OSFA can consider a Special Circumstance based on 2022 household income.
If the loss of income is due to involuntary unemployment, we will not be able to review a student’s situation until ten weeks after the separation date. Please submit the Special Circumstance Form (which can be found by going through the link https://secure.osfa.illinois.edu/specialcirc/,) along with the supporting documentation provided by the family to re-evaluate a student’s need-based aid eligibility.
