Newly Admitted Students & Financial Aid
Congratulations on your recent admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Now that you are admitted, our office will begin reviewing your FAFSA or Alternative Application. Check the Financial Aid section of your ‘Newly Admitted Student Checklist,’ available through your MyIllini account. Here you can confirm we received your FAFSA, and you’ll find any outstanding requirements under the ‘Student Requirements’ section. All requirements must be submitted and the review process completed before we can finalize your financial aid for the 2022-2023 academic year.
Financial Aid Notifications for students who were not required to submit additional documentation and those who have all their documents completed will begin receiving their Financial Aid Notifications in mid-March. Your Financial Aid Notification will outline the aid you qualify for based on your FAFSA or Alternative Application, including grants, scholarships, Federal Work Study, and/or loans.
