Financial Aid Programs
Federal, state, and institutional student financial aid programs are available to cover your cost of attendance. Completing the FAFSA is the first step in determining your eligibility for most financial aid programs.
Veterans Educational Programs
Federal and state veterans educational programs are available for active duty service members and veterans of the U.S. Armed Services, and, in some cases, the dependents of service members.
Resources received through most federal veterans educational programs don’t affect financial aid eligibility. The following links provide additional information on these programs and the processes that must be followed to utilize these benefits:
