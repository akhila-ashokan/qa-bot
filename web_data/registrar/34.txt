Apostilles
An apostille is the legalization of a document for international use under the terms of the Hague Convention.
Illinois graduates who plan to work or further their education abroad may need to authenticate their degree(s) and transcripts with an apostille.
It is imperative that you verify the specific documents and authentication required by the receiving country. More information regarding authentication of American academic credentials for use abroad is available at the U.S. Department of State website. For those countries that do not recognize the Hague Convention or that do not accept the apostille, the U.S. Department of State has an Office of Authentications which can provide a federal authentication. Please note: if federal authentication is required, you must be sure to request the documents be returned to you, in order for you to complete the process.
The apostille process includes:
Completed requests will be processed and mailed to the Secretary of State within 3-5 business days.  Allow 4 – 6 weeks for processing by the Secretary of State’s Office.
Contact the Transcript Unit at transcripts@illinois.edu or 217-333-9778 if you need an apostille.
