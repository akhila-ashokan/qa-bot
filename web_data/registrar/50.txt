The campus fees are approved by the University Board of Trustees and applied based on the number of semester hours for which students enrolled in campus-based programs and independent non-degree courses are registered, in addition to other criteria. Students enrolled in fully online degree, certificate or non-degree programs are not currently charged campus fees. Fully online PROGRAMS are different from campus based programs where students happen to be enrolled fully online for a semester.
