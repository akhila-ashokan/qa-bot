Refunds
Reduction of Billing Hour Range
If you reduce your billing hours to a lower tuition range (e.g., from Range I, which is 12 or more credit hours, to Range II, which is 6 to 11 credit hours), you receive a refund of the full difference between the two ranges, provided the change is made by the drop deadline for the particular Part of Term (POT) in which your courses are scheduled. NO REFUND IS AVAILABLE FOR DROPPING A CLASS AFTER DEADLINES LISTED BELOW. No refund is available at any time for reducing credit hours WITHIN the same range. Refer to the Class Schedule for what POT each course is scheduled in to assist with identifying deadlines.
Tuition Assessment Ranges – Fall & Spring
In all cases, a student who wishes to drop ALL classes in a semester to discontinue enrollment must withdraw from the university by completing the withdrawal process by the stated deadline.
Refund Schedule
Following are the refund schedules for the university, listed by term. See our academic calendars for information on official academic dates, including the deadlines for adding and dropping classes.
