FERPA
In 1974, Congress enacted the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) to guarantee students access to their educational records and to prohibit dissemination of educational records without the student’s consent.
Illinois has established guidelines for implementation of this law, which are contained in Section X-6 of the Campus Administrative Manual and Part 6 of the Student Code and the University FERPA and Compliance Page.
Congress recently enacted an amendment to FERPA that enables an educational institution to disclose details of disciplinary action against a student for conduct that poses a significant risk to the safety of others in the school community.
