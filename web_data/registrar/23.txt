Financial Aid
At Illinois, we encourage everyone to apply for financial aid. Please see the Office of Student Financial Aid for more details.
There is no need-based financial aid available to international undergraduates, and F-1 visas allow very limited opportunities within the University for students to work. Thus, all foreign undergraduate students must have sufficient funds for their entire period of study. For more information on scholarship and loan opportunities, please visit the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) website.
For more information on financial aid for graduate students, please see The Graduate College website.
