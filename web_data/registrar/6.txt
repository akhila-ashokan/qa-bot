Welcome to the Office of the Registrar

The Office of the Registrar is the steward of official student academic records and is responsible for the accuracy, integrity, and security of those records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
In partnership with various campus units, we implement, support, and uphold academic policies related to class and event scheduling, registration services, enrollment and degree verification, assessment of tuition and fees, grade processing, degree audit configuration, and printing of official academic transcripts and diplomas.
