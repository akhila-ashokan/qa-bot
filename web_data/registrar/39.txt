Tuition & Fee Rates
Use the Illinois Cost Calculator to obtain an estimate of your tuition, campus fees and other estimated costs by answering a few questions or to compare program options.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign follows the Undergraduate Guaranteed Tuition Program (UGTP) state law for all undergraduate, degree-seeking students. UGTP guarantees students the same tuition schedule for 4 years, assuming continuous enrollment in the same major. At the end of the 4 years, a student who has not completed his/her degree will be placed in the tuition cohort immediately following. After 2 years at that rate, the student will be placed on the non-guaranteed schedule.
Review our tuition and fee rates by academic year or by term. An academic year includes the fall and subsequent spring terms.  Note that all tuition and fee rates are subject to change without notice.
Tuition and fee rates by Academic Year with estimated expenses for previous years can be found in this Archive. Tuition and fee rates by Term for previous terms can be found in this Archive.
