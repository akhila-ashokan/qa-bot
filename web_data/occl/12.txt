Students can choose to live in University Housing, Private Certified Housing and apartments and homes that are privately owned. There are many advantages of living on campus and studies have found that students who live on campus are more engaged and more likely to be successful students. Each individual must evaluate the pros and cons of living independently within or beyond the Campus District.
Set a Budget
While rent will be your largest expense, it not your only expense when living off campus. Expenses can add up.
Below are some basic guidelines about rent prices:
It is important to know what utilities you will be responsible for before you sign the lease. Ask for specific clarification with landlords that advertise "utilities included." You may also want to be cautious with the word "supplies" instead of "pays." If the landlord pays the bills for heat and water, the lease should clearly state, "Lessor shall pay all bills for heat and water."
Below are estimates to help you plan:
It is important to know the parking options and costs before you sign your lease. Below are some estimates to help you plan:
Roommates
Before you choose an apartment and sign a lease with someone, it is wise to get to know them. Make sure you are compatible with them. Once you sign the lease, you and your roommate(s) will be legally responsible for the rent, fees, utility bills, etc. The presence of a roommate conflict will not excuse you from this legal obligation to the landlord.  If one of you fails to pay the rent, the landlord can, and usually will, sue all of you. If the person who did not pay leaves, the roommates who paid their rent will face a lawsuit for eviction. Even if the landlord does not evict, expect that all of the roommates, including the one who left, will have the bad debt listed on their credit records. Very few landlords anywhere in the United States will rent to you if your credit record shows that you owe a landlord rent.
This Roommate Agreement Contract (pdf) will not protect you from joint liability to the landlord, but it can be helpful for deciding in advance what youâll do if one person leaves before the lease is up, and for reminding each other what you agreed to before a conflict occurs.
Sometimes landlords provide individual leases for one personâs share of the apartment. In these cases, you would not be responsible for your roommatesâ rent. However, this can cause different issues for tenants:
Conflicts with roommates can occur. Below are some tips to help you mange the conflict and come to a mutually beneficial solution:
Try to avoid these common pitfalls in conflict:
If you are struggling to find solutions, consider utilizing the Office of Student Conflict Resolution. They provide mediation services and advice to roommates experiencing issues.
Discuss this before you sign a lease together. Are you confident that each of your potential roommates would continue to pay his or her share of the rent if a replacement tenant cannot be found? Don't assume that the replacement tenant will be someone you know. If you find one at all, it will probably be a stranger. Please know that it is very, very hard to find replacement tenants.
Are you confident that each of your potential roommates would continue to pay his or her share of the rent â no matter what happens? Many students do not return to school after the first year because of their grades. They either get a job or transfer to an easier school. Sometimes, they leave because they can't afford to pay for school. Will they be able to afford to pay for an apartment in which they are not living?
Would you expect a roommate who leaves to continue to pay an equal share of all utilities? Some utilities (for example, roommate keeps paying a share of the power and water bills but not for cable TV and internet)?
Is everyone in your group willing to accept a stranger as a subtenant to replace an absent roommate? Are there any limitations on who that person can be (for example, must be a certain gender or must be a student or within a certain age range)?
Have you discussed whether you want to try to find subtenants (which carries some risk, namely that subtenants will do damage for which original tenants end up paying) or whether you will just pay rent for an empty apartment or your empty space in an apartment where one of your roommates stays for the summer?
If you find one or two people to sublet but do not find one person to replace each of the original tenants, how will you apply the payments from the subtenants â share equally among all original tenants or will each person who found someone get the money paid by the person they found?
If any one of you stays in the apartment for the summer, will they be willing to live with subtenants who are strangers?
How will you handle division of utility bills? For example, if one of you stays for summer, one of you finds a subtenant and two of you leave without finding subtenants, will the utility bills be divided 4 ways, 2 ways or will you devise some arrangement for the absent people to contribute to the cost of summer utilities but pay a lower percentage of each bill than the two living in the apartment?
Search Tips
Students tend to live in Urbana, Champaign, Savoy, and even the surrounding towns. You can use the information below to determine what may be the best option for you.
There are many housing options. Your search will be easier if you identify your needs first.
Research the area. You can utilize the following to help you make an informed choice:
Utilize Housing Explorer to identify options advertised specifically to students. However, there are many ways to identify housing options including asking friends, local newspapers, ads in the Daily Illini, and online search engines.
Call landlords and schedule appointments to view the inside of several apartments.
	Utilize the Apartment Hunting Checklist (pdf). If you will have a roommate(s), all parties should see the space. If you like the place, ask for a copy of the application and lease to take home and read. You may be pressured to sign immediately, but it is important to take the time you need to make sure that this is the right space for you.
