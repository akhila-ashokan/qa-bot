Obtain Renterâs Insurance
If you suffer property loss as a result of burglary, fire, tornado, water leaks, lightning, or a power surge, you will need your own insurance to cover your loss. Your landlord's insurance does not cover your personal property.
You can buy renter's insurance for as little as $10 per month.
Some students choose to be covered on their parents' homeowner's insurance. Often, that policy will NOT cover hotel stay if fire forces you from your home and may not provide other coverage such as liability if you accidentally started the fire. If you are considering coverage through a parent's policy, check with the insurance agent about the scope of coverage.
How much will it cost today to replace property stolen by a burglar or damaged by fire? The cash value or depreciated value of your property is much less than the replacement cost. It is wise to buy insurance that pays replacement cost instead of cash value.
Some policies include a dollar limit of $2,000 or $3,000 for hotel bills if fire forces you from your home. Many policies will cover hotel stay for the shortest period of time necessary. Check your lease to see how long you have agreed to wait after a fire for your landlord to make your apartment livable again. Most leases say 30 days, but some have 45, 60, or even 90 days. Be sure your "loss of use" coverage is enough money to pay for replacement of all of your damaged property plus a hotel for the amount of time you've agreed to in your lease, plus a few additional days to shop for a new place, in the event that the landlord is unable to make the place habitable within the time specified in your lease.
This is the amount you pay before the insurance company will cover a claim after a burglary, fire or some other covered calamity. Most renter's insurance policies have a deductible of $250 or $500. A few also offer $100 deductible for a higher premium cost. Usually, your premium (the amount you pay for the policy) is higher if your deductible is lower.
How much would it cost to replace everything you own: computer, television, VCR/DVD, CD-player, clothing, books, bicycle, etc.? Add the cost of hotel in case of a fire, and that would be the amount of coverage to buy. Most young tenants who rent furnished apartments and do not have a lot of property buy a $10,000 or $15,000 policy. If you own your own furniture or have more than one computer or own other expensive items (jewelry, big screen TV, many oil paintings) you may need a $20,000 or $25,000 policy. Remember to calculate the cost of hotel stay for the amount of time equal to the grace period in the fire clause of your lease. Add to that the cost of replacing everything you own and that is the amount of coverage you will need.
Be sure to ask your agent if damage to property from roof or pipe leaks or other water damage is covered. Other than fire and burglary, the most common complaints to Tenant Union about property damage involve water leaks.
These are often exempt from a standard policy. If you are renting a basement apartment or house with a basement, you may need to purchase an additional rider to your policy to cover damage from water seepage or sewer back-ups. Ask your insurance agent about coverage for these problems.
Off-Campus Community Living does not recommend any specific insurance policy. Check with a few agents to see what policy options they offer and compare costs. You may be able to get a small discount on insurance premiums if you buy both auto and renter's insurance from the same company. Following are names (these are not recommendations) of several insurance agents in the Champaign-Urbana area who sell renter's insurance.
Keep Documentation
Keep a copy of your lease, and any written communication between you and the landlord.
If there are conflicts or disputes between you and your landlord, you will need this documentation especially if you plan to seek representation from an attorney.
Pay Rent and Utilities On Time
Not paying your rent on time can result in late fees and potentially eviction. If you think you are unable to pay your landlord on time, see if you can come to an agreement for repayment. If you do reach an agreement, get in writing to protect yourself. Depending on your lease, you will likely have to pay at least some of the utilities. Late payments can result in late fees, harm to your credit, and make it difficult for you to transfer service if you want to move.
Moving In
Moving Out
Keep Apartment Clean/Undamaged
It does not necessarily have to be spotless, but you should clean and take out the trash regularly. This is important to avoid damage to the apartment and unwanted pests. Additionally you cannot alter the apartment without consent from the landlord.
Notify Landlord of Repairs
If something in your apartment needs to be fixed, notify your landlord right away. Some landlords use online maintenance requests systems or email. If not, provide a formal letter with a list of repairs needed and request that they be completed within a specific timeframe.
Notify Landlord of Pests
If there are pests in your apartment — ants, roaches, rats, mice, bed bugs — you need to report these to your landlord immediately. Some landlords use an online request system or email. If not, provide a formal letter. If you do not report, the landlord might refuse to exterminate or may charge you for extermination especially if you are responsible for the infestation.
Do not use bug bombs — they are not effective on bed bugs, and will encourage the bugs to spread to other apartments to get away from the fog.
You can also let others know there is a bed bug problem at your building by registering at www.bedbugregistry.com.
In most cases, your landlord will be responsible for extermination to eliminate pests but there are some exceptions. If you are identified as the cause of the infestation, the landlord might refuse to exterminate or will charge you for extermination. If the building has roaches and you are a very bad housekeeper, the landlord might even try to charge you the cost of exterminating the entire building. With bed bugs, if you discover them soon after first moving in, it's hard for the landlord to blame you. But a few months after you move in, the landlord might say you brought the bed bugs into the apartment. Given that bed bugs can be dormant for several months AND they can travel on the pants of workers or people to whom the landlord shows the apartment for leasing, it's hard to establish who brought in the bed bugs. Tenant Union would encourage a landlord to exterminate for any pests, including bed bugs, to prevent the problem from spreading to other units. Including a pest control clause in your lease increases the likelihood that you will get the landlord to provide and pay for pest control when needed. In the cities of Champaign and Urbana, the property maintenance codes require a landlord to exterminate before leasing and to eliminate infestation if it is in more than one apartment.
Noise/Disturbances
Under the provisions of most leases, you will agree to keep noise levels to a minimum so as not to disturb your neighbors. If you violate this clause, you could face eviction. If police find you in violation of the city's noise ordinance, you might be fined $150.00 - $200.00 for each occurrence. Despite the risks, some tenants make a lot of noise. If you have trouble with one of your neighbors making too much noise, try these ideas.
If the people quiet down when the police arrive but start up again a half hour later, call the police again and tell the dispatcher that an officer responded to your earlier call but the noise-makers started up again after the police officer(s) left.
If the problem persists on subsequent nights, be persistent in calling the police. They seldom write a ticket for the first noise offense.
If you have an ongoing problem that is not resolved by calling the police at the time of each incident, you may wish to call the police station and ask for the Shift Commander (Champaign: (217) 351-4545; Urbana: (217) 384-2320).
Your landlord is not a police officer. When you experience the type of problem for which a homeowner would call the police, you should call the police too. Particularly if you are being bothered by someone you are afraid to confront -- an intoxicated person in your hallway or a vandal damaging cars -- don't expect your landlord to replace a police officer. Call the police.
If you receiver an eviction notice from your landlord because the neighbors have complained about you making too much noise, don't move out! Call Student Legal Services to find out about your options and risks. Moving out will not necessarily excuse you from the obligation to pay future rent.
Be a Good Neighbor
It is important to have a good relationship with your neighbors. Be kind and respectful in all interactions. Follow the law and lease guidelines around behavior in common areas.
Be a Good Roommate
You and your roommate(s) are legally responsible for each otherâs payment of rent and utilities. The circumstances of a conflict between you will not change this fact. Treat each other with respect especially when you are in conflict and find a solution that is mutually beneficial.
Provide Written Notice
Provide written notice when you intend to not renew your lease and move.
This is your legal responsibility. Please check your lease for the due date that this needs to be completed.
