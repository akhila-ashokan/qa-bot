Welcome to Off-Campus Community Living!
We provide support to students residing in privately owned apartments and homes.
Over 20,000 students choose to live in privately owned apartments and homes throughout the campus district and surrounding communities. Whether you are living in the campus district or in the surrounding communities, you are considered to live "off-campus."
Off-Campus Community Living remains available to assist students, but we are not currently scheduling in-person meetings. To schedule a virtual meeting, please call (217) 333-0112 or email us.
