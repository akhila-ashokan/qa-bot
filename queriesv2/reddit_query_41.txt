Why should I go to UIUC over another big 10 school? Hi! Recently admitted high school senior here. I want to know why I should go to UIUC instead of specifically Indiana University or University of Maryland.

A couple things about me- I’m from illinois, both of my parents went to uiuc, and a TON of kids from my grade usually end up at uiuc. I am a pretty strong student—top of my class at a big public hs outside chicago. I applied to LAS with a psych major and I’m leaning in a law school direction. I think I will probably rush a sorority and I’m super interested in undergrad research. 

Give me your best sales pitch!
