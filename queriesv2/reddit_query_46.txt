Exchange Student Incoming Semester 1 2021 Hi guys, I am an exchange student coming in this term 1 of 2021 (this august). I am studying mechanical engineering and I recently got approved for the VISA to the US so I am a bit late in my application process.   


Currently, I need to mainly apply for the housing and meal plan at UIUC. So, any suggestions? I discovered that ISR and LAR will be good choices as they are close to the engineering building but I am still confused. My requirements would be:  
1. close to classes so I can wake up 20 mins before and still make it   
2. coed  
3. air conditioning (don't know how much in it matters Illinois weather but just in case)  
4. would be amazing if had a music room!  
5. social community as I would love to make lots of friends during my exchange  


That's it. And as for the meal plan, on the website, I saw the plans were for a year. However, I will be on campus for only a semester so is there a way I can reduce the price?  


Cheers!
