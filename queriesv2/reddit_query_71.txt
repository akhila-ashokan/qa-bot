Looking for Off-Campus Housing I'll be joining the iSchool this Fall for grad school. I'm currently looking for 3BR apartments which are 10 mins walking distance from the School of Information Sciences building (501 E Daniel St, Champaign). What resources shall I use for this process? The Off-Campus Housing section is not operational right now. Also, I'd like the apartment building to have good access to bus services.
