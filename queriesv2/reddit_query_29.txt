Honors LLC Rdquirement Confusion As an incoming freshman registering for courses today, I am trying to make sure I don't screw up my first semester.

I am going to dorm in the Honors LLC but was confused about their course requirement. On their website, it says "First-year Honors LLC students take a one-credit-hour course. This course introduces students to the Honors Living-Learning Community, their fellow Honors LLC students, and Honors programs at the University of Illinois." However, I couldn't find a more detailed description of the course, course number, CRN, etc.

I registered for a section of the CHO 199 Honors Uncommon Reads, which is 1 credit hour. It just doesn't seem to fit the bill of a class introducing students to the LLC. Is this the right course? Should I look for another course?

Please send help before I get kicked out for not meeting the LLC requirements. Thanks.
