How do I know if my covid vaccine is approved? Incoming freshman here. 

I uploaded my covid vaccine on June 30. I haven’t received any email saying it’s approved. When I checked my MyMckinley, it said under “immunization” that my overall status is verified. Does that mean my covid vaccine is already confirmed?
