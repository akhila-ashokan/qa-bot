Which vaccine is available on campus? I'm currently at home but plan to come back to campus very soon. 

There's a chance I'll be able to get my first vaccination done soon but I may be traveling back to campus before it's time for my second dose.

Both vaccines are available here so I'm wondering which one does CU have so that I can take the same one here, or does the type of vaccine not matter for first vs second dosage?
