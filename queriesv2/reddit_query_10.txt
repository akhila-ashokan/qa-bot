Question about using safer illinois It’s my first time being on campus and I was planning on moving in monday into my dorm. I just learned you need a negative test or to be fully vaccinated for covid to get the key. I’m vaccinated and I already submitted my covid vaccine to mckinley and it says that it’s verified on my immunization records. I just downloaded safer illinois and logged in with my netid and it says I need a covid test. Will this update since I just set up my account? Or does anyone know what may be wrong? Should I print a picture of my record to bring to move in just in case? Thank you!
