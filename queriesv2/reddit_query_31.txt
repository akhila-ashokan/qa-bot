Any grad students looking for housing for fall 21? Hey y’all. I’m a grad student here and my family and I are relocating at the end of the summer. We’ve signed a lease for our current place for this coming year that we need out of and are trying to help find a new tenant. 
Some quick info on the house:

3 beds, one bath
Pet friendly
Good, non slum-lord landlords who own lots of properties in the neighborhood 
Fenced front and back yard
Washer and dryer in the basement
Tenants-only fitness center in neighborhood 
Five-Ten minute walk to downtown Champaign
Ten minute bus ride to campus 

We’ve lived here five years, so we liked the place! If you want more info or pics, please message me!
