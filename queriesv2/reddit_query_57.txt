Kitchens in dorms? Hey guys,

I'm a freshman who's gonna enroll at UIUC this Fall. I will live in Evans Hall and I have the 10/45 meal plan. This means I only have lunch and dinner during the week, and I have to figure out something for breakfast and during the weekends. Is there somewhere in Evans Hall where I could cook myself some meals, like eggs in the morning ? How do other students do who are on the same meal plan as me ?

Thanks
