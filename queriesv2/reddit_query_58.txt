Moving to Champaign soon. Need help I’m gonna be starting my masters program (uiuc) in fall 2022 and until then I want to move to Champaign and find a job. Does anyone have an idea of how I can find a place with students this far out in the semester? I know it’s fairly a hard time to move in considering it’s almost been a month since the first day of classes.
