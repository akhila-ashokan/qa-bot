Housing? Hi guys, I’m an incoming international transfer student and I was looking at housing options. I was wondering if I had to live on campus because I’m a new student? Or does it only count for freshman’s? And if I don’t have to live on campus, where would be a reliable place to find a studio apartment off campus? I’ve never been to the states and I won’t be able to visit until I actually go to start school. Would appreciate any help you can give me :)
