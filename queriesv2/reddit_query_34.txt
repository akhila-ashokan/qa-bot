Life as an in state student at UIUC Hey! So I’m an incoming in state student at UIUC and I’m excited to come to campus this fall, but honestly I have just heard about UIUC being the school that everyone goes to as a hs in Illinois and I feel rlly invalidated by those comments said to me. A lot of other ppl from my school are also going to UIUC, and I’m a little scared that I won’t truly grow out of that inner bubble. I REALLY want to branch out as much as possible since I have zero interest in staying in connection with those ppl (who I find mostly annoying tbh). Ig I’m just looking for comfort in the sense that I can have that new and fresh start college experience that other ppl have who are going out of state for schools. For the in state students who had a lot of ppl going to UIUC from their hs or area, how did you grow out of that bubble and start that new college life?
