Transfering to CS Transfering to CS

Howdy,

I am a sophomore at UTSA(University of Texas at San Antonio) majoring in CS and have a 4.0 gpa. I also did a summer internship at Hewlett Packard. I know that it is extremley hard to transfer into CS major at UIUC. Do you have any tips for me before I apply for the Fall semester?

Thank you
