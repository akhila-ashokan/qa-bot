Upperclassman living on campus I’m wondering how common it is for a senior to live on campus? I’ve looked at apartments and most affordable options I saw were pretty shitty and I’ve seen many posts about apartment agencies trying to scam everyone it just doesn’t seem worth it?

I ended up signing a housing contract for Nugent but I’m worried I might like an apartment better. The only thing is I don’t want to stay in Champaign for a whole year lease (I live in Chicago) and by staying on campus my contract is done is May.

*Looking for advice/ any experience with this*
