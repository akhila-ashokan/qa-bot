IB Credits Hi,

I will most likely attend UIUC this fall with a major in electrical engineering. I wanted to know how IB credits work at UIUC. I've read UIUC's website and the [pages](https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/measurement-evaluation/placement-proficiency/proficiency-testing/international-baccalaureate-scores) for IB credit and according to those pages, I can get around 30-35 hours worth of credit from my ib diploma.

According to the EE's curricula [page](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/ugrad/curriculum/ee-curriculum-06), I will need 128 hours to graduate, of which, 66 hours will be from the required courses.

1. Does this mean that I will only have to complete around 93 hours to graduate, allowing me to finish my degree in 3 years?
2. Is there a limit to the number of IB credits that I can claim?
3. Is there something that I'm missing here?

Btw, my HLs are Math AA CS Physics.
