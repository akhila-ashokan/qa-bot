UIUC Undergraduate Psychology Program Info? Hey all :)

As the title says, I'm wondering if any current or former students (relatively recent) can give any insight into the resources, networking, professors, name recognition, etc. of the undergrad psychology program at UIUC. I'm a high school senior awaiting my decision, and I'm planning (at least at the moment lol) to pursue graduate and post-grad education in the field so I'm interested in what a UIUC degree would do for me, what it would mean to professionals, etc. The university's program is ranked 7th and 8th by U.S. News and Gourman Report of Undergrad Programs respectively, but I know these rankings are very surface-level and don't come close to giving the complete picture.

UIUC is one of my top schools, and I'm just trying to find out as much as I can while I pass time waiting for decisions. I'd really appreciate any info anyone is willing to offer :) Thanks!
