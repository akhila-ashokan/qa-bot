Housing issue Hi, I'm a rising freshman and will join School of Information Sciences this fall. 

As I am going through the housing contract, it seems there are several options for residence halls. 

Is there a good choice for a student at IS? Or any recommendations for a freshman student? 

Thanks in advance.
