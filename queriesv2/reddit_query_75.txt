Can Illini Tower Ban Guests? I was trying to work on a group project at my friend’s place at Illini Tower, but I was turned away at the door because they have a no-guest policy and I’m not a resident. The policy is in place because of COVID which is fair, but also no guests is kind of ridiculous in my opinion.

At first I was like whatever we’ll just work at my apartment instead, but then I started to wonder if that was even allowed. Illini Tower calls itself student living so I’m not sure if it’s an apartment building or not, but if so I assume [these Illinois state rules](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/guest-policies) would apply and let me go in anyway? They said it was private property and that they can impose any rules they want so I took them at face value, but I was just curious if anyone had any insight into this.
