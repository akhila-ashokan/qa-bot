How many people are in each phase for covid vaccinations in Champaign county? [This](https://www.c-uphd.org/covid-vaccinations.html#) website gives some interesting information on how far we've gotten with covid vaccination in Champaign county (e.g. the current phase, the list of phases, how many people have been vaccinated, how many are eligible), but it doesn't say how many people are in each phase so it isn't clear how close we are to getting to the next phase. Where can I find this information? Is it even available?
