Class of 2025 Aerospace Engineering Admit I was accepted into the aerospace engineering program for Fall 2021. I am fairly certain that I will attend UIUC... my decision is between UIUC and Texas A&amp;M. Cost will not be a huge factor in my decision as I am an Illinois resident, but also received an OOS tuition fee waiver to Texas A&amp;M (cost would be comparable). I am seeking any advice on the school or the AE program to aid my decision/assure me that UIUC is the best choice:

\-Which dorm would be best for an engineering student?

\-What should I do to best prepare myself for the program? (Summer classes, online classes, etc)

\-Is there anything that I should know about the program before accepting my offer? (Good or bad)

\-How do you feel about choosing the aerospace engineering program at UIUC as a current or former student?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your responses!
