Apartment Financial Aid I’m planning apply next week when applications open and transfer to UIUC from CCC. When I hopefully do start next Fall in 2022 my plan is to stay in an apartment. I should qualify for Illinois Commitment to cover my tuition but how would aid for my apartment work? On the FAFSA I did select off campus instead of on campus because I plan to stay in and apartment, so I’m not sure if that has ever made a difference for anyone?
