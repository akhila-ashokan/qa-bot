Uploading Vaccine Verification on Safer Illinois app Hi I'm an incoming out-of-state freshman. On the Safer Illinois app, how do I upload vaccination proof when I got vaccinated from some other state? The only two options I see on the app are Mckinley center and OSF (which seems to be Illinois based).
