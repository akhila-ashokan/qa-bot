Transcripts submission method? Hey guys, I'm a prospective freshman for UIUC and I'll be joining in fall 2021. I do have some queries as I'm confused at the moment about how I would send in my final transcripts. I was told by admission that I had to send them through an electronic vendor like Naviance or BridgeU but they all require accounts that have codes that universities give them. I'm pretty sure they're for current students at universities. I was also told that I cant send the transcripts any other way. What should I do? How did the current students at UIUC send in their transcripts?
