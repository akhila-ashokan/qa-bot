Transfer Student Host? Hi there--

I'm a potential transfer student looking to experience life (or as close to it as possible) as a student at UIUC before I make a final decision. I'm a current sophomore at the University of Nebraska (I'm not transferring because of the football game, don't worry) studying Biochemistry. I can totally get a hotel and everything, but I would love if somebody would be willing to bring me around campus for a day or two or like a Friday and Saturday so I can see what the culture is like, eat on campus, see classes (if possible w/ COVID, if not I understand) and the other little things that make a college decision important. Please feel free to comment or DM me if you'd be willing to consider doing this--happy to provide more info about me! I'm very flexible on the dates since I can tune into most of my current classes asynchronously. Thanks, I really appreciate it!
