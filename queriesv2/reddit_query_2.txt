Is there anyone who came to UIUC through "pathways to Illinois" from a community college? Hello, I am an international student, and I am interested in studying computer science at UIUC. Is there anyone who came to UIUC through "pathways to Illinois"?([https://admissions.illinois.edu/apply/pathways](https://admissions.illinois.edu/apply/pathways)) 

Does UIUC accept computer science majors from "pathways to Illinois"? Also, is the admission guaranteed if I satisfy the requirements, or do I have to go through a competitive and holistic review by admission committees where I have to send essays and proofs of extracurricular activities?

I have dropped out from California community college this semester and have 7 W's on my transcript....(I had to take classes from 2:00am to 7:00am, 5 days per week, and couldn't take it any longer...) Would this jeopardize the transfer process? 

Thank you for reading the post!
