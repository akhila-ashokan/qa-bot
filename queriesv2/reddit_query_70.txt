Credit transfer I am a freshman in Grainger and planning to take couple summer courses at a local college (out-of-state). Couple questions below and appreciate your input:

1. Do I have to get pre-approval from Grainger for each course?

2. Is there any limit in terms of number of courses you can take from other institutions?

3. How does the grade show in your transcript? For instance, a 3.6 will indeed be counted as 3.6 in your GPA calculation?

Thanks in advance!
