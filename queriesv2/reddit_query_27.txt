Anyone else confused on whether or not their submitted vaccine record went through? I had submitted a picture of my vaccine card to McKinley back when the school first sent the email out and thought it went through bc I got a "completed" screen. But after checking back a few weeks later, the upload form to submit was open again and no where in the McKinley portal did it say I had ever submitted a photo. 

I thought I just did it wrong the first time and re-submitted my vaccine card and once again got the "completed" screen. I go back to check a few weeks later and the same thing happened again.

Idk if I am doing something wrong, but I was wondering if anyone else was having a similar problem or if it was just me.
