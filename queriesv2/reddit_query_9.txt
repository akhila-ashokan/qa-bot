when applying, is the major we choose the one we have to do??  **First-Choice Major**  
Select the major you intend to pursue at UIUC. Our Gies College of Business offers several business-related majors, but all first-year students enter the college through the Business Undeclared program. We strongly encourage you to visit our [Program Explorer](https://myillini.illinois.edu/Programs) before choosing your first- and second-choice majors.  

&amp;#x200B;

 In selecting a second-choice major, you intend to pursue a degree in that field if admitted. Illinois residents who are unsure of other majors to pursue, should select the Undeclared program. Non-Illinois residents are not typically admitted to the Undeclared program as a second choice due to limited space, but are encouraged to select another major as a second choice. A second-choice major will not be considered if it matches your first-choice major.
