Got accepted into UIUC as a transfer, how are the scholarships? I know the school’s expensive, and I know my brothers who got in as nontransfers could afford it (barely) so how are transfer scholarships? If it helps, I’m going in as a sophomore from a non-CC and I live in Illinois. My college would be CLAS.
