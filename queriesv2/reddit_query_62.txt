received no aid from the school. help! ok so I'm an incoming in-state freshman and I was offered literally $0 from FAFSA and the school. uiuc is my first choice so now I feel kinda stuck. is there anything I can do to get some form of aid from the school??? (also if worse comes to worst, I do have a backup school but I would like to see all of my possible options before making a decision)
