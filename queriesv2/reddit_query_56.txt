Vaccine Requirement (This is mainly directed at those with medical and/or religious exemptions from the vaccine, but other responses are welcome!) 

Is anyone else a bit scared that their exemption will not be approved? 

My dad and I both have a genetic medical condition (thanks dad ðŸ™„) and so our physician advised against getting the vaccine. My dad didnâ€™t listen, and got both doses, but had a terrible reaction and is still not back to normal months later. Iâ€™m so so safe about COVID. I wear a mask everywhere, even outside, and I get tested daily at the Union.

Iâ€™m just worried and wondering if anyone is in the same boat. I also have a friend who religiously opted out of the vaccine at another university, but was denied and had to transfer schools because of this. 

Please do not send hatred, I wish I could get the vaccine, and I hope to somewhere down the time, but i am not willing to put my life and everyday at risk when I am being safe.
