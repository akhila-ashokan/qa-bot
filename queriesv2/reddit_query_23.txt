COVID testing question from a UW-Madison student Hello!

I’m a student at UW-Madison, and this semester we’ve all but stolen your COVID testing protocols with biweekly mandatory saliva tests and an app to prove your negative status.

The beginning has been rough though, taking over an hour in some cases to get tested. Scheduling is packed and many students are reporting having saliva rejected - not to mention standing in an indoor space maskless less than 10 feet apart drooling....

Would you care to share your experience with the system?
Did things get better on your campus as time went on?
