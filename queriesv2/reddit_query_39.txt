UIUC counselor suggestions Hey there,

I would like to seek some suggestions about counselors at the Counseling center in our university since different counselors are different. The experience that I will have will be so different according to the different counselors I consult with. 

so if you have ever had such experience of visiting there and had a good experience, could you reply here with his/her name and his/her style? I would very much appreciate this help!

here is the list of counselors which might help you get refreshed.
