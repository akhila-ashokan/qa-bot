Are You Getting a COVID Vaccine When You Arrive? I’m a journalist who has covered COVID_19 on campus for NPR[NPR](bit.ly/covidcampusnpr) and The Washington Post[WashPost](bit.ly/covidcampuswapost) since early 2020. 

I’m working on a story about yet another year of campus life under the shadow of a pandemic.  I would very much like to speak with students planning to take advantage of the university’s walk up vaccinations Aug. 16-19 at the State Farm Center.  

Please reach out to me via email, stretch@illinois.edu if you would like to talk. 

Thank you.
