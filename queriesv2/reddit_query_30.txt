ADVICE for CS freshman at CC! Hello everyone! So Iâ€™m a CS freshman, starting out at a US community college (Illinois) with a plan to transfer in two years! UIUC is one of my prospective schools. Not being in university, I obviously lack the resources/network that I would have had there..

I would love some advice on how to productively use my time here at cc for CS from ya'll who might have taken a similar path, and ended up transferring to UIUC.

For those who have transferred successfully, I'd like to know how and what made you stand out as a transfer applicant in cs?

Thank you for your time!! Have a good day!
