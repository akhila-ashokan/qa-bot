chancellor’s scholar questions 1) is the campus honors program actually a well known program on campus or is it just kind of there and ppl who do it are the only ones who know about it?

2) is the program worth it? if anyone here is in the program, any insight would be greatly appreciated!

3) do you suggest living in the honors llc (wardall)? i’m seeing mediocre reviews about isr so i’m wondering if it would be better for me to look into other dorms 

ty in advance for your help!
