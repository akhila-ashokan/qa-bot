Need help choosing a gen ed (engineering major). I'm going to be a freshman studying EE this year and as of now, I'm taking Eng Orientation, Math 241, ECE 110, and Chem 102/103 (prob will switch to Phys 211) for my fall semester. I'm looking for an easy and interesting gen ed to add as well. Some common ones I've seen on here are CLCV 115, REL 110, and MUS 132, but unfortunately, these don't seem to work with my class schedule.

I'd appreciate any recommendations and it'd be great if you could add a little about the workload for the course. Thank you!!
