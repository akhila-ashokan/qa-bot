I am a junior in high school and need some advice on what to do. Hello everyone. I am a junior in high school and live in Illinois. UIUC is my first choice then UIC. So what do I have to do to get in during my junior and senior year. I have a 3.8 gpa out of 4 but have only took one honors class. I have yet to take my SAT and next semester will be taking AP economics. Should I take any dual credit classes next year or take it easy?
