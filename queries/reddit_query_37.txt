Accepted to Gies!. What’s up y’all, I just got accepted to Gies on Friday and I was wondering if you can give a prospective freshman some advice and insight on Gies and the school as a whole. I was also wondering what costs look like for an OOS student. I’m absolutely thrilled at getting into UIUC but cost is a huge factor for my family and I. Thanks for the help y’all!
