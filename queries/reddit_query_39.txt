Important Requirements for Traveling from India to Chicago. As I'm planning my travel to get to the campus, I was wondering what are the important documents that I should be mindful of and have to carry to get through immigration as well especially during COVID? I would really appreciate if someone can share their experience/logistical planning who recently travelled from India on student visa.

Additionally, please free to share any suggestions or tips for new students on campus (and USA).

Thanks in Advance.
