Transcripts Help. So I’m planning to apply for transfer for Fall 21, I just need to get my High School transcripts sent via email.. Does anyone the email my school counselor can send them to? Since I graduated already I had to provide her with the email myself and I found etranscript@illinois.edu on the UIUC Undergraduate Admissions website but my counselor told me the address wasn’t found when she tried to send my transcript over.

I don’t think I can email UIUC for I would need a reply by today in order to have my materials all sent in by Feb 1. Maybe I didn’t look hard enough? Can anyone help?
