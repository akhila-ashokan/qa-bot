Are incoming freshmen allowed to apply for undergraduate jobs starting that are in fall 2021?. Basically the title. I was looking around for in-campus jobs for undergraduate students. I’ve seen jobs (library jobs to be specific - that are now accepting applications)

Are incoming freshmen allowed to apply for this position?

I emailed the person they mentioned to ask for questions, but they haven’t responded and it’s been about 2 weeks. 

Any thoughts are appreciated! Thank you!
