Prospective Student Applying. Hi guys! I’ve been looking at cs/math courses as a freshman next year and was planning on applying to UIUC. However I can only apply to a couple of colleges since it’s out of state. Anyone know the pros of these departments at UIUCor the college in general (how easy it is to get a job, etc.)
