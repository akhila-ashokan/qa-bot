Prospective Chemical Engineering Major. Hi, I'm an upcoming freshman looking to go into a chemical engineering major. I have credits from SLU 1818 for APUSH, AP Lang, AP Chem, AP Physics 1, and AP Bio as well as credits from SWIC for AP Psychology and look to take calculus and macroeconomics courses there this summer. What schedule will/should I have? The courses listed above give significant college credits and could lead to a graduation in three years.
