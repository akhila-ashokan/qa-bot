Engineering frats: are they worth it for networking?. I'm a rising freshman planning on majoring in MechE. I've been thinking if joining an engineering frat for the sake of networking but have come to realize that it could be kinda expensive.

Ultimately, I'm hoping to use the experience to get academic support (especially for the intro/gen ed classes) and also build future professional connections. Would an engineering frat be good for that?
