Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) II. As many of you know, a new stimulus bill was signed the other day. This bill includes extended relief for college students (including grad students) through the HEERF II fund. Please note that this is different from the CARES Act, which is the original emergency dean fund that some of you may have received money from last Spring. This is round 2! 

I haven't heard UIUC say anything about this yet, but hopefully they will in the next few days. It sounds like students may be notified based on their FAFSA EFC. However, the school has also began to set up application pages such as this one: [https://grad.illinois.edu/covid-19-emergency-grants-graduate-students](https://grad.illinois.edu/covid-19-emergency-grants-graduate-students) 

According to the webpage linked above, people are now able to use this fund in order to help pay tuition. This was not a qualifying reason for the first round of HEERF. Here is another helpful page with more information: [https://www.nasfaa.org/heerf\_ii](https://www.nasfaa.org/heerf_ii) 

Just wanted to share this with you all! Please leave any other relevant information in the comments.
