UIUC incoming freshman question regarding college advisor. UIUC gave me an assignment that I have to complete as an incoming freshman. On one of the parts, it asks us to write what classes we want to take first and second semester.  I just wanted to know if that is like a finalized decision, or after I submit the assignment, I am going to talk to my college advisor about the classes I chose before the decision is like set and stone. I am sorta confused.
