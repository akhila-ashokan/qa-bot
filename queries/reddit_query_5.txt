MS STAT ll TA/RA opportunities. Hey guys

I am an incoming MS STAT student this fall. I had a few questions regarding assistantships. 
1.  how we can apply for Assistantships from this fall semester itself? 
2. Which professors/departments are most likely to offer Assistantships to a new grad student from statistics department? 
3. How do I prepare myself to get an Assistantship with tution fee waiver? Are there interviews or tests?
4. Is there an online portal where we can get to know about available assistantship opportunities? 

I know these are too many questions. Thanks in advance
