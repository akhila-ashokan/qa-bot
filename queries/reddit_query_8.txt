How to report an positive Covid test from off-campus over Winter Break. If you tested positive over break, the university wants you to report the test to them so that they can better deal with you testing positive after returning (i.e. not require you to quarantine again if possible).

A massmail was sent out with instructions on December 7: [https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/1233261494.html](https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/1233261494.html)

The text of the massmail follows: 

**Submit your positive off-campus COVID-19 test results**  
December 7, 2020 2:01 PM

Dear undergraduate and graduate students,

We know many of you plan to be away from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign community during Winter Break. Because of this, there is a chance that you may test positive for COVID-19 at an off-campus location. If this happens, we request that you submit your positive off-campus COVID-19 test result through the [MyMcKinley Portal](https://mymckinley.illinois.edu/).

**How to submit your positive off-campus COVID-19 test result**

1. Log into the [MyMcKinley Portal.](https://mymckinley.illinois.edu/)
2. Click on the “Upload” button on the right side of the menu header.
3. Choose “COVID-19 Outside Results/Notifications – Urbana-Champaign Campus Only” from the drop-down menu.
4. Upload your positive COVID-19 test result file.

**Important notes**

1. The university needs your positive off-campus results to speed the processing of any repeat positives once you return to campus.
2. The university needs your positive off-campus results to evaluate your testing requirements if you live in a location that is asked to test every other day. (Currently, individuals who have already tested positive and been released from isolation are not required to increase their testing requirements.)
3. We only want your positive off-campus test results. Please do not submit any negative results. Negative off-campus results do not replace any mandatory on-campus testing requirements for those who are in the Champaign-Urbana-Savoy area.

Please submit your results well ahead of the beginning of the Spring 2021 semester to ensure a smooth transition.

Thank you so much for all of your efforts to maximize our safety this semester. We hope once this semester is finished, you are able to enjoy a well-deserved break before restarting your classes, research or work.

Sincerely,  


Danita M. B. Young  
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
