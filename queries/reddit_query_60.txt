Could anyone show me a single massmail that explicitly says you need to abide by the testing schedule even if you 100% wfh?. I am an alumnus and a personal friend to Ivor, and I have been trying to understand what the entire story was exactly by going through all the massmails sent out in the fall semester at  
[https://covid19.illinois.edu/more-information/massmail-announcements/](https://covid19.illinois.edu/more-information/massmail-announcements/).

I am struggling to find a single time that they explicitly stated or explained students who are 100% working from home also need to participate in the twice-per-week testing schedule. I have always seen the requirement for testing rtied directly to access to campus buildings -  then if I don't need access to campus facility why do I need to be tested? How am I effectively different from a guy living 2000 miles away? If I were Ivor I would have very possibly taken the same actions as he did, if all those massmails are the only guidance I received from the university.

I mean - even if testing requiremen for wfh students WERE explicitly stated, a direct disciplinary escalation to dismissal still looks like an extreme overkilling. But if the policy was not even communicated clearly in the first place, I really don't see any authority the university has to even start a disciplinary process.

Am I wrong? I am reading through all the messages in a batch so I could have missed some information. Relevant info could have also been communicated in a different message not listed in those massmails, so if you could point to me anything I missed please let me know.
