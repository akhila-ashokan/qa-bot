W in transcript. W in transcript

I got accepted to UIUC recently, but I am afraid the university might cancel the acceptance if I get a W in my senior transcript. The thing is, I am taking an online course from Johns Hopkins CTY, but due to personal issues, it seems very hard for me to finish the course before the due date, which is the end if April. I am rushing through the lessons, but my grades are slowly descending, and I donâ€™t know what to do at this point. Our high school counselor said to me that if I drop this course, W will be on my transcript and warned me the university might rescind the acceptance.

Should I continue to take this course risking my GPA, or should I just drop this course and focus more on my high school subjects?

My major will be electrical engineering and I have 23 credits by taking AP psych, calc bc, chem, com sci A, physics 2, and stats. My GPA is 4.01 weighted 3.82 unweighted.
