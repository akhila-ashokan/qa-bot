Looking to connect with people at babcock! (Also, any tips for incoming freshman?). Hii, i will be housing at babcock this fall and if any freshman wanna connect, it would be great :D

Also, for anyone who has lived there, is there anything i need to know about before coming? Like things I should avoid, or definitely do after going there.
