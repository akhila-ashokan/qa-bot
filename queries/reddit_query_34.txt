Can anyone give advice on university choosing. Ok. I applied the spring semester transfer. By now I received mathematics offer from uiuc champagne and cs offer from Pittsburg as well as cs major from Rutgers Newark cs offer. 

I’m really tore now . I want to learn cs coz I’d like to stay in us after graduation, hence cs is the most ideal . Easy to find a job, also decent wage. 
But my family support me uiuc, because they think its ranking is higher and reputation better, they can support me to master. So I can transfer to cs in master period. 

What should I choose. Can anyone analyze for me? Thanks so much
