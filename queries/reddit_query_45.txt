Spring 2022 Transfer Odds. I have a 3.9 GPA at the University of Michigan and just applied to transfer next semester (Spring 2022). I applied to the Statistics and Computer Science major as my 1st choice and the Statistics major as my 2nd choice. 

I saw some discussion about these majors being really difficult to get into, but I’m hoping I should have a decent chance because it’s in LAS. What are your thoughts?
