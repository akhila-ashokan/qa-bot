PREP Pre Engineering program?. My high school senior applied for Computer Engineering for next fall. Today he was notified he was accepted into THE PRE-ENGINEERING PROGRAM (PREP). I think that means he starts freshman year in the Division of General Studies and if he keeps a 3.75 GPA, they will allow him into the Computer Engineering program after that.  Does it sound like I understand it right?

The big question is what if he ends up with, for example, a 3.4 GPA? What happens then? 

Any advice or guidance will be appreciated. Thank you.
