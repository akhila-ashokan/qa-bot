Not sure who to contact about taking summer courses. I’m an incoming freshman and I want to take the equivalent of Calc 220 at my local community college this summer. Everything I’ve read has said to talk to your academic counselor but I haven’t revived their contact info yet bc my meeting is June 9. Who should I reach out to for this? I will be entering ACES. TIA!
