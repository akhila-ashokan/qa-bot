Diabetes Research for Product / Service Creation -- share your diabetes journey. Hello, I am a student that goes to the University of Illinois. I and my classmates are trying to create a product or service to benefit diabetics and caregivers alike. We will keep all your responses confidential. If possible, please make sure that you fill out the initial section regarding contact information if you are okay with being contacted for an additional interview to discuss your needs out of a diabetes management product/service, or to share regarding your experiences with diabetes.
