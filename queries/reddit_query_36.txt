Signing up for Classes. Hi I'm an incoming freshman signing up for classes. I'm signing up for this particular course, and it seems like the lecture and lab are still open, but all the online discussions are full. Since the discussion is linked, it is required that I sign up for it.

Is this possible? Does it mean I'm unable to take the course? Should I email my counselor?
