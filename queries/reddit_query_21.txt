SRAR Question.  Hi Guys,

I am a international student applying for admission in the Fall of 2022. I had a question relatedd to self reporting grades on the application.

 I have given the IGCSE. I was wondering if I should only report my final IGCSE grades or also the results of school's internal exams? On the website for GCSE, UIUC says do not report internal school exam scores however I am not sure if this applied for IGCSE as well.

If any of you have faced a similar situation, please let me know what you guys did.

Thank you so much for your help in advance.
