Transfer to UIUC Gies. Hello, I'm planning to transfer to UIUC in fall 2022, trying to major in Information Systems (or another business degree). I just wanted to know the likelihood of me getting accepted and if there is any advice to increase my chance. I'm attending a Community College with a 4.0 GPA and just recently started taking honor courses (1st sem of the second year). I did drop 1 course which resulted in me having a "W" in my transcripts (primarily due to unfortunate timing and the professor's teaching style). I did not take any extracurricular activities during my first year and plan not to take them in the second year (unless you recommend me to take them). I do work a 20-30 hour part-time job, IDK if that would be a substitute for my absence in clubs. I'll also complete all the required courses to transfer into Gies after the spring sem finishes. 

(If you have any more questions for me, please ask) THANK YOU!
