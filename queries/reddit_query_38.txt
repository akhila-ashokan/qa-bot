Can I still get COVID tested through the university even though I graduated in May?. Hey so I’m visiting some friends in Champaign this weekend and we all want to get tested before hanging out. I’m a former student at the university and I was wondering if I could still get tested through the system even though I’m no longer enrolled. If so, how does the process work?
