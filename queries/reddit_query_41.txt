DGS or somewhere else?. HS senior deciding on a school. Got denied from Gies as first-choice major, accepted DGS second-choice. I've been accepted at other colleges for business majors or pre-business (albeit a little less competitive/selective than UIUC, still good schools). 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I go to UIUC as undecided and try to get into Gies after \~1 year? Also still somewhat undecided on an actual major (split between poli sci and something in business), so would it be better to enroll in DGS or attend somewhere else that I have been directly admitted into their business program? I ask this because I've done some poking around on this sub and it seems like there's a lot of people that dislike DGS and a smaller percent that actually like it.
