Am I eligible for EPI (oral English proficiency) test?. Hello I am incoming UIUC MCS student, graduating from another institution(ASU).

I would like to apply for the TA position and am wondering if students who finished his undergraduate in another school and admitted by UIUC can also take this test.

The website says "Students are eligible to take the EPI if they have completed an undergraduate degree **and** are admitted into a graduate program at Illinois. Undergraduate students and students not yet admitted to an Illinois graduate program may take the TOEFL iBT or IELTS to demonstrate oral English proficiency for teaching." I am not very sure about the definition.
