UIUC faculty and staff will be required to get vaccinated for COVID-19 before the fall semester. From the Chancellor

 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Dear faculty and staff,   
&gt;  
&gt;As  you may have read in a message from President Tim Killeen, the  University of Illinois System  is requiring that faculty and staff at all three universities  (Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield) receive a complete course of  COVID-19 vaccines before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester, if  they are able to do so. For employees covered by a union  contract, guidance will be implemented through the applicable  collective bargaining processes.   
&gt;  
&gt;When  we announced the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for our students  several weeks ago, you  may remember that we said at that time there were no plans to do the  same for faculty and staff. Since that time, the System made the  decision to require COVID-19 vaccinations for faculty and staff. We  fully support this decision and believe that widespread  COVID-19 vaccinations at our university provide the best opportunity to  maximize the safety of our entire community.   
&gt;  
&gt;Though this requirement is new, operationally, our protocols for the Fall 2021 semester will  remain nearly identical to those previously announced:   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Faculty and staff should be vaccinated for COVID-19 if they are able to do so.  
&gt;  
&gt;Faculty  and staff who are not vaccinated will continue to be required to wear  face coverings and participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing  program. For the Fall  2021 semester, this means testing and receiving negative test results  twice per week.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  university is following Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention  (CDC) guidance and accepting vaccines currently authorized for emergency  use by either the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization.  
&gt;  
&gt;Vaccinated faculty and staff should submit their Vaccination Record Card to the [ MyMcKinley Portal ](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/SGSCWA4UrRx2tEi_tSTIBQ~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRi2s2_P0QfaHR0cDovL215bWNraW5sZXkuaWxsaW5vaXMuZWR1L1cDc3BjQgpg7r9I-GD611xFUhVqbHBoaWxpMkBpbGxpbm9pcy5lZHVYBAAAAAQ~)and have it verified.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have not been vaccinated for COVID-19 and you are able to do so, visit [ vaccines.gov](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/-8ItL9t8373AN-scvcVR1A~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRi2s2_P0QZaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmFjY2luZXMuZ292L1cDc3BjQgpg7r9I-GD611xFUhVqbHBoaWxpMkBpbGxpbm9pcy5lZHVYBAAAAAQ~) to find available appointments or walk-in hours in your local area.  
&gt;  
&gt;If  you are not able to be fully vaccinated before the beginning of the  Fall 2021 semester (due to timing, travel, etc.), please continue to  test until you are fully  vaccinated and your Vaccination Record Card has been uploaded and  verified in the [ MyMcKinley Portal.](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/SGSCWA4UrRx2tEi_tSTIBQ~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRi2s2_P0QfaHR0cDovL215bWNraW5sZXkuaWxsaW5vaXMuZWR1L1cDc3BjQgpg7r9I-GD611xFUhVqbHBoaWxpMkBpbGxpbm9pcy5lZHVYBAAAAAQ~)  
&gt;  
&gt;We  acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other  reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. For those individuals, the  COVID-19 testing program and  face coverings will continue to be required.  
&gt;  
&gt;[The  CDC has shared data showing that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/VRo0tOEjvOaf4UDoK3nJHQ~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRi2s2_P0RRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2RjLmdvdi9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy8yMDE5LW5jb3YvdmFjY2luZXMvc2FmZXR5L3NhZmV0eS1vZi12YWNjaW5lcy5odG1sVwNzcGNCCmDuv0j4YPrXXEVSFWpscGhpbGkyQGlsbGlub2lzLmVkdVgEAAAABA~~), and fully vaccinated individuals can start to resume most aspects of pre-pandemic life. The [ CDC has also provided guidance about COVID-19 vaccinations for higher education institutions](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/Hu4Yb_Sz2jS88rx-2ov9Yg~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRi2s2_P0RmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2RjLmdvdi9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy8yMDE5LW5jb3YvY29tbXVuaXR5L2NvbGxlZ2VzLXVuaXZlcnNpdGllcy9jb25zaWRlcmF0aW9ucy5odG1sI3NlY3Rpb24yVwNzcGNCCmDuv0j4YPrXXEVSFWpscGhpbGkyQGlsbGlub2lzLmVkdVgEAAAABA~~) that further strengthens the System's decision to require everyone (faculty, staff and students) to be fully vaccinated.    
&gt;  
&gt;I know that during this pandemic, new guidance and expectations have changed quickly. Thank you  for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.   
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,   
&gt;
