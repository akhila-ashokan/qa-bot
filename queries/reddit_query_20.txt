FRESHMAN ECE SCHEDULE. Hey everyone,
I will be an incoming CompE freshman at UIUC this fall and I was just wondering if you guys could give me some advice on my planned courses for first semester of freshman year. 
I am coming in with a decent amount of AP Credit so this is my plan for first semester:
ECE 120 - 4
ENG 100 - 0
MATH 241 - 4
ECE 110 - 3
CLCV 224 - 3
I will also be trying to proficiency out of math 241 and if I pass I will take MATH 285. 
Let me know if you guys have any suggestions. Thanks!
