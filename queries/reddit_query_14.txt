OOS transfer student attending the springâ€™22 semester. I have been recently admitted to kinesiology for AHS. I am attending UIUC this upcoming spring semester as a sophomore and I would like to know how the University is. I also want to know from Kinesiology students on how the major is like in terms of workload and academics or anything else really. I am coming from a local community college in Texas so I am going to need to adjust in a completely different setting on my own. Feel free to PM me about what I just mentioned above, I would like to start knowing people at UIUC early on.
