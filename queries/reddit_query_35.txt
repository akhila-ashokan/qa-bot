Research, Teaching Assistantships and Residential Advisors!. Hello!

I just committed to UIUC, and since I am taking out a student loan, was looking at ways to save some money on campus. I heard Residential Advisors get free room and board, but I believe that doesn't apply to freshmen, and I was looking at stuff mainly catered towards freshmen

What are some ways that I significantly reduce my tuition / living cost while in Illinois. (I am on an F1, so I don't believe working will fetch me much, as it is limited to 20 hours a week). I will be attending the Grainger College of Engineering for CS.

Also, what are some ground realities that only a student knows about these posts? How easy / hard are they to get, what are some issues associated with them, is it worth it, etc.

Thanks so much!
