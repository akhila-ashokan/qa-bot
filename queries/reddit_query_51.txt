Question about vaccine eligibility in Rantoul. Hi everyone,

I signed up for a vaccine appointment tomorrow in Rantoul through Monday’s massmail which stated that all UIUC students are now eligible for the vaccine. However, I believe that the official description for the appointment stated that these appointments are for Champaign county residents. I have a lease in Champaign and am living on campus this semester, but my permanent address that appears on my ID and what not is in Chicago. I doubt that it will be an issue as the massmail did say that all UIUC students/faculty/staff are eligible, but is there any chance that I won’t be able to go through with my appointment due to this? Thank you very much in advance!
