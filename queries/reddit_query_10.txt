Looking for an Unofficial CS Tour Guide (Paid). I wanted to see if anyone would be willing to tour my family and I around the UIUC campus. 

I’m applying as a freshman CS major, though I am a college junior through my high school DE program. I go to school in FL but I live in Chicago during the summer, so I’m very flexible availability wise.  

I’d prefer to tour early to mid-July in the morning. We’re willing to pay $25/hr for a 2-3+ hour tour. Also, please be fully vaccinated!

DM me if you’d be interested.

Thanks!
