Honors LLC Fall Orientation. I'm a freshman entering the Honors LLC at Wardell this coming year. Looking at the Honors LLC Website, there's a fall orientation which starts on August 18 that you have to pay for to be a part of. 

I'm really interested in going to orientation, but it doesn't mention anywhere where I should pay the fee so if someone could point me to the right direction, I'd really appreciate it. 

TIA,

Semny
