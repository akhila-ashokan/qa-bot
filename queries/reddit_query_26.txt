Please Give An Incoming Exchange Student Some Advice about Class Schedule!. I'm an incoming exchange junior student major in ece. I will take ece391 next semester. I would also like to take ece428 ece422 and one Gen course. Is that doable? I also need advice for another course to choose. And recommendations?
