Freshmen Summer Programs?. Hey y’all!

I’m an incoming freshman majoring in EE, and I was wondering if there are any major specific summer programs for incoming students? My sister attended a different college, and over there they had a two week “bridge program” over the summer for new CS students where they basically offered introductions to the intro-level CS classes and helped adjust the students to college life, so I was just looking to see if UIUC offered something similar for ECE? If not, that’s totally cool.

Thanks!
