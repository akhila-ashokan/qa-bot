Supplementals for a Prospective CS Student. Hi everyone!! I am currently a high school senior who will apply to Illinois through the priority deadline. I was curious if any current students (CS majors currently, but anyone else also works) could review one of my supplementals: how my major aligns with my future career goals. If anyone is interested, can you please let me know so I can DM. Thank you in advance and if you do not want to read them, that is fine and I thank you for your time. Go Fighting Illini!!
