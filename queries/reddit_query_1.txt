&gt;**U of I System statement on student vaccination guidelines for fall**   
 June 21, 2021 11:16 AM   
&gt;  
&gt;Dear students, faculty and staff:   
&gt;  
&gt;To  continue our commitment to collective safety, the University of  Illinois System will require  that all students receive a COVID-19 vaccination if they plan to be on  campus for fall semester 2021. This requirement is consistent with our  own scientific modeling of the risks associated with the spread of the  virus and its variants. It is also consistent  with the Illinois Department of Public Health’s goals.   
&gt;  
&gt;We  recognize that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons  why they cannot be  vaccinated. That is why it is so important that those of us who can get  vaccinated do so. Those who are not vaccinated will need to follow  campus-specific guidelines and any exemption protocols issued by each  university. Individuals who plan to work or study  remotely are exempted from these requirements.   
&gt;  
&gt;Throughout  the COVID-19 crisis, students have helped make the University of  Illinois System a  model for the nation – a model of community, a model of safety and a  model of pulling together for the common good.  We look forward to their  help in setting the standard again this fall, a semester that will  restore most in-person instruction and many of  the other traditional rhythms of campus life that COVID interrupted  last year. Widespread vaccinations will help us do that.     
&gt;  
&gt;Each  university will follow up with additional guidance on vaccination  information as well as  other safety measures planned for fall. We also will continue to  monitor our policies closely, making adjustments as appropriate based on  advances in scientific understanding and updated guidance from public  health authorities.   
&gt;  
&gt;Guidelines for faculty and staff are still being developed and will be shared later this summer.   
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,   
&gt;  
&gt;Tim
