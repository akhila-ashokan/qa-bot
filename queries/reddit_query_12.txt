Quick question about community college transfer class. Incoming ECE freshman here. So I’m taking a replacement for physics 211 at a local community college during the fall. If I took physics 211 at UIUC, there would be a prerequisite/concurrent requirement for calc 2, but my community college only requires calc 1 (which I have). I’m kind of doubting a 4 on my BC exam so I was planning on taking calc 2 during the spring. Would my cc physics class transfer (even though I don’t have the calc 2 requirement)?
