How to convince my parents to let me live in the dorms when I'm a townie. I'm a lifelong townie and prospective UIUC student who is currently a senior in high school. UIUC is one of my top choices on my list because I'm interested in engineering and I'll be familiar with the campus and the area if I go here. Especially if I get into my first choice engineering major, I only have to pay like 8k tuition since both my parents work here and I have tons of connections with professors and labs through my parents. 

However, my tryhard Asian parents have constantly been telling me bullshit and saying that if I can't get into a "better" university, they aren't willing to pay more than the 8k tuition. I will have to live at home with them, commute every morning and every evening, and pack lunch every day, almost like a high school student. I have struggled with depression for much of my high school years and they always call me a pussy or a wimp when I tell them I need help, among other things. I'm really worried that if I have to live at home, their toxicity and controlling character will negatively impact my mental health. 

My parents are familiar with places like Kams and Lion and they think I'll just spend late nights drinking and partying there or fooling around in the dorms. I tried to tell them that it will be hard to make friends without being in the dorms but they just make the excuse that at least some of my high school friends will also be at UIUC and I can see them in class. Do you have any advice on how to convince my parents to let me live in the dorms?
