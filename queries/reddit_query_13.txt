Classes registration question. I’m an incoming freshman (starting first year of college in Fall 2021). 

I accepted my James Scholar invitation over a month ago. 

I’ve already completed the placement exams I need to take before I can schedule my registration. When I was choosing a date to meet up with my advisor, the earliest option I had was June 7. When I looked into the UIUC website, it said that James Scholars get to register on April 19?
