Off campus transfer to gies fall 2022. Hello, I'm planning to transfer to UIUC in fall 2022, trying to major in accounting(or finance). I just wanted to know the likelihood of me getting accepted into gies and if there is any advice on increasing my chances. I'm attending UIC with a 4.0 GPA, Iâ€™ve taken all the prerequisite courses listed on the transfer handbook. I am a member of the pre law Society, accounting club, and political science student union. I also work a 20-30 hour part-time job. 


If you have any more questions for me, please ask. Thanks!

Also please share any tips regarding essays. 

I believe the prompt is something along the lines of: Explain your interest in the major you selected. Describe how you have recently developed this interest, inside and/or outside of the classroom, and how this major relates to your professional goals.
