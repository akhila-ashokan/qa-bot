Chemical Engineering/Transfer/Off-Campus housing. Hi Everyone!

I just got accepted here as a transfer and I wanted to know what it's like being a chemical engineering major/transfer student at Illinois. If anyone has any experiences they'd like to share or general advice, do tell! I'm still deciding so please be brutally honest. If I do commit, I also want to go for off-campus housing so if anyone could tell me where I could find affordable housing in the area and how early I should start looking, that'd be great as well!
