When should I apply for a job on campus?. I would wanna work on campus when I get to UIUC this fall as a freshman. I was looking at the jobs which are currently [available](https://web.housing.illinois.edu/HESStudentPortal) but I wanted to know if its better to wait a little while longer?

What do you suggest?
